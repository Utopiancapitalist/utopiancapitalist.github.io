# Welcome to the Utopian Capitalist

This is a collection of essays on finance, economics, philosophy, and public policy.

I’m passionate about learning how the philosophic and economic decisions made by businesses ultimately affect society, as well as how policy can influence these decisions for good and for ill. It is in search of answers related to these relationships that I began my vocational endeavors. Looking ahead, I want to continue to research and learn, hone my undergraduate thesis written on the morality of the corporation, and research policy surrounding the private equity firm.
