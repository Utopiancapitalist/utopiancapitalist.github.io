*Note: This post is a continuation of the investment banking interview question series.

One of the most known qualities about investment banking is how competitive it is. Students make efforts to attend elite schools, and [grades are considered even from high-school (A-levels).](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/01/top-graduates-missing-out-on-banking-jobs-for-lacking-polish) Given this, the following series on interview questions will work through many of the questions that may be expected amidst a banking interview.

### Questions for the week (Accounting Focused):

#### How is IFRS/GAAP accounting different from tax accounting?

_A: IFRS/GAAP accounting is accrual based while tax accounting is cash based. In addition, there are a number of adjustments to consider. The most noticeable of these differences is that tax accounting uses particular depreciation methods. In the United States, common tax useful lives are 3,5,7, 10, or even 40 years (Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System, or MARCS is used). In general, tax useful lives are accelerated versus GAAP, which most frequently uses straight-line depreciation._

#### Walk me through how you create a revenue model for a company

_A: There are two common revenue models: Bottoms-up, where 1) individual products are taken, 2) an average sale value is assigned, and 3) a growth rate in sales is multiplied by the average sale value. The second revenue model is the tops-down model, which begins with metrics like market size, and then considers how the market size may change in coming years. Note that of the two methods, the bottoms-up method is preferred. _

#### How would you build an expense model for a company?

_A: An expense model would be built with a bottoms-up method similar to the revenue model noted above. Begin with each department in the company, the number of employees for each department, the average salary, bonuses and benefits. Assumptions are made from these. COGS should be a percentage of revenue, and each unit produced should be an expense._

#### How is Current Year Retained Earnings Calculated?

_A: Retained earnings is calculated by taking the prior year Retained Earnings and adding current year (CY) net income, and subtracting issued dividends. The purchasing of treasury stock is also subtracted from retained earnings._

#### What are some examples of non-recurring charges, and how might they affect one's view of financial statements?

_A: Non-recurring charges are items such as restructuring charges, asset write-downs, bad debt write-downs, legal charges, accounting adjustments, and other impairments. These can skew the net income of a company by greatly reducing net income for the current year, despite not being influential in future years. A common practice for public companies today is to release two sets of financials- one adjusted to remove these charges (Non-GAAP) and one with regular GAAP. The logic behind this is to show investors that underlying metrics are strong, even if net income may have been impacted by recent one-time charges._

#### How does one project Accrued Expenses in a 3-statement model?

_A: Project Accrued Expenses as a percentage of SG&A._

#### How does one model in Net Operating Losses (NOLs)?

_A: Create a book versus cash tax schedule, where one can calculate Taxable Income based on NOLs, and compare it to taxable income without NOLs. The difference in this schedule is linked as an increase to Deferred Tax Liability on the Balance Sheet._
