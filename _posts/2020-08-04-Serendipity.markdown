These are the moments that have brought us to *here*. \
To *this* spot. \
To a place of belonging. \

*Here* is where the waves tickle against the pier, \
giving offerings of tranquility amidst the weary stillness \
of a silent city. \

For it is a smile from beyond that we are here. \
It is Aspen's gift of feathery fluff, \
floating through the air to find its way to you. \

And it is you \
so focused on your individuality that you forget \
about the nurturing grasp of those around you \
who know who you are in the way a dog and tabby \
know one another - a peculiar friendship \
that softens the hears of those around them. \

Serendipity is the solitude of pressing play on an iPod \
and discovering a new song that tastes \
of the fragrant emotions you've felt before \
but have not had the foreknowledge to search for. \
Until now. \

You are here in this moment. \
And you do not allow this patch of pause \
to take your breath away. \

And yet it does \
leaving you tired \
weak at the knees \
a slobbering, slick kiss \
from that dog who, \
for a moment, \
tamed the tabby.
