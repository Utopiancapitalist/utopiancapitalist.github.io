One of the most known qualities about investment banking is how competitive it is. Students make efforts to attend elite schools, and [grades are considered even from high-school (A-levels).](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/01/top-graduates-missing-out-on-banking-jobs-for-lacking-polish) Given this, the following series on interview questions will work through many of the questions that may be expected amidst a banking interview.

### Questions for the week:

#### How would you value a peach tree?

_A: You would value a peach tree in the same manner you would value any other investment. You would first consider any relative comparables (orange tree, apple tree, etc.) and then look at the cash flows for the peach tree (intrinsic valuation)._

#### Name two common multiples used for a valuation

_A: P/E ratio (Used for relative comparables in the same industry), Enterprise Value/EBITDA, Price/Book Value_

#### What are the differences between and when would you use EV/EBIT, EV/EBITDA, and P/E?

_A: EV/EBIT refers to the ratio of enterprise value over earnings before interest and taxes. This is a standard valuation metric, which would be used for a company with a high value of fixed assets or software (i.e. a manufacturing company). EV/EBITDA is enterprise value over earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, and it would be used when the company *did not* have a high level of fixed assets (i.e. an internet company). P/E is the price-earnings ratio, and it is used when comparing to other companies within the same industry. P/E depends on the capital structure, whereas EV/EBIT and EV/EBITDA are capital structure neutral._

#### When would you use liquidation valuation?

_A: This would only be used in bankruptcy scenarios, to consider whether equity shareholders might receive any capital after the company's debts have been paid off._

#### What is an LBO?

_A: This is a model used by buyout firms to contemplate how much ought to be paid for a company to hit a target IRR (internal rate of return). This IRR target is usually ~20%._

#### What is Replacement Value?

_A: This is when on values a company based on the cost of replacing its assets._

#### What are the 3 major valuation methodologies, from lowest to highest value?

_A: There is no definitively set order, but the following is a typical order:_
1. _Precedent transactions, as companies pay a premium to purchase another Company._
2. _DCF, as the construction of the DCF tends to rely on optimistic assumptions._
3. _Comparable company analysis, as it does not take account premiums or synergies into account._
