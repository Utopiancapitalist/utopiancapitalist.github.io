China has been a country on my mind for some period of time now. A driving question I have is *why investors have remained so careful to avoid investing in China?* 

### China National Interest Rates From 1995 to 2019 as Compared to the United States National Interest Rates

<img src="/assets/1995-2019-China.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Interbank Lending from 1995 to 2019"/>

*China is graphed in violet, while the US from 1995 onwards is graphed in yellow. US Fed rates prior to 1995 have also been included in green.*

I have three initial thoughts about this:

1. China has kept their interest rate remarkably steady throughout this ~25 year period from 1995 to 2019. 

2. Recent news reports suggest [China is unlikely to follow the US in cutting the interest rate.](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3019798/china-unlikely-follow-us-federal-reserve-interest-rate-cut).

3. Chinese companies should be expected to play an increasingly important role in investor's portfolios. 

I hope to contribute more thoughts and analysis to this sector in the near future.
