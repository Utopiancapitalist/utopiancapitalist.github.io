*Note: This post is a continuation of the investment banking interview question series.

One of the most known qualities about investment banking is how competitive it is. Students make efforts to attend elite schools, and [grades are considered even from high-school (A-levels).](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/01/top-graduates-missing-out-on-banking-jobs-for-lacking-polish) Given this, the following series on interview questions will work through many of the questions that may be expected amidst a banking interview.

### Questions for the week (Enterprise Focused):

#### What is Enterprise Valuation?

_A: Enterprise valuation is calculated as the total value of the company, including assets, liabilities, and equity. To calculate this, one must add equity and debt, less cash and cash equivalents. It can be thought of as the price another company would be willing to pay to purchase the company. An alternative view is to calculate it using the present value of the company's future free cash flows._

Note: Consider the following excerpt from McKinsey's excellent Valuation Guide:
" Enterprise value is the value of the entire company, which equals the sum of the core operations plus nonoperating assets. Subtracting debt, debt equivalents, and hybrid securities, and making other adjustments, provides an estimate of the value of equity."

#### Walk me through how you would forecast performance

_A: Forecasting performance takes the following steps:_
_1. Prepare a three-step financial statement model_
_2. Build a revenue forecast model_
_3. Forecast the income statement and then the balance sheet_
_4. If necessary, forecast the investor funds into the balance sheet_
_5. Calculate end results, primarily Return on Investors' Capital and FCF._

#### T/F: EBT should be used as a driver for calculating the tax rate.

_A: False, as the tax rate is set by government stipulations irrespective of earnings before taxes, barring any adjustments that would cause the earnings to be taxed at a higher or lower tax bracket._

#### T/F: Company data should be collected before beginning the financial modeling process.

_A: True. This ought to be organized separately from the model, with the assumptions brought into the model at a later point. Raw data from company executives should remain unmodified._

#### Why is Cash subtracted from Enterprise Value?

_A: Cash is subtracted from enterprise value because it is expected to be used to pay the buyer in the purchase of the company. In addition, Equity Value technically accounts for this as it is a non-operating asset._

#### What are the steps involved in a bottom-up revenue forecast?

_A:_
_1. Estimate demand from existing customers_
_2. Estimate customer turnover_
_3. Estimate potential for new customers_

#### What is WACC and How is it calculated?

_A: WACC, or Weighted Average Cost of Capital, refers to the opportunity cost for an investor choosing to invest in the particular business as opposed to an alternative business or opportunity. It can be thought of as the discount rate in a simple finance calculation, but its complexity goes much beyond this. It is calculated by 1) taking the cost of debt (i.e. 10%) as multiplied by the ratio of debt to total market value (debt + equity) in the company, and 2) taking the cost of equity (i.e. 8%) as multiplied by the ratio of equity to total market value (debt + equity) in the company._


*Next week's questions will consider the Cost of Capital (WACC) in further detail.
