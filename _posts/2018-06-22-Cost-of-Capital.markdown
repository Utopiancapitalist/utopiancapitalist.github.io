### What is the Cost of Capital?

The question of Cost of Capital []

### What different approaches to Cost of Capital exist?

### How is WACC modeled?

The revolver should work in tandem with the cash balance. In essence, a revolver balance should grow if there is a deficit, while cash should grow if there is a surplus (unless there is first a deficit, in which case the revolver should be reduced). The deficit/surplus can be calculated from the cash flow statement.

--> The MIN function can be used for this calculation
--> Note that circularity may occur, resulting in an Excel error. To account for this, simply enter the Excel options, go to the formulas tab, and click the "enable iterative calculation" button.
